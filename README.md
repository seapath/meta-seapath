# meta-seapath

This is the core of the seapath project.
The meta-seapath repo contains the yocto Seapath layer, which contains all the code (yocto recipes) needed to build the seapath images used to install seapath (host, guest, flasher, etc.)

# WARNING
The Yocto scarthgap migration is in progress and does not work yet. Please use
the Yocto kirkstone branch.
